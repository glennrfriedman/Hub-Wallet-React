# Hub-Wallet-React

Hub Wallet is a project that aims to assemble the most comprehensive set of crypto portfolio tracking possible. 

The aim is 3 fold: 

1 - Allow users to enter price of purchas and purchase amount and track users gains/losses based on price per coin or token at purchase. 

2 - Allow users to track their portfolio growth with information about ROI, daily growth, and more. 

3 - Allow users to calculate amounts of gain or loss incurred during tax year and calculate capital gains tax for profits or deduction allowed for losses for users automatically. The lead developer is a C.P.A. (me).

If you have any questions or would like to help out please contact glenn@hubwallet.io 

I hope to launch soon!
